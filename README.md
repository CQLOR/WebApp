# WebApp
Through the admin tab this Web App will take data provided on the Sales Form and store it in a google sheets table. 
It will also display all of the data within that table and calculate the total. 
After submitting the form refresh the page in order to update the YTD Sales table provided in the web app. 
The data table also includes sorting and pagination components.

Also, I have included the Google API App Script code in a file called Code.gs

This WebApp is is a template for a SalesTeam or individual who would want to keep track of their YTD monthly sales.

Node.js packages have been installed. Lite-server dependencies were installed to run the project:
npm install
npm start
